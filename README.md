Simple app to manage lists of current reading, want to read and already read books. 

Built with React and React Router. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). The starter template for the assignment (including CSS styles) can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## API

This applications consumes data from an API designed specifically for the assignment.

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
